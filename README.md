# Georeferenced locations and environmental data from collection effort of shallow lakes dispersed over a 250 km² landscape in São Paulo State, Brazil 
The planktonic microbial communities were sequenced in an illumina MiSeq. The raw data is public and can be found in the __NCBI database__ under SRA accession number [PRJNA411849](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/411849).

This data was used in the manuscript entitled:_"Beyond environmental selection – Exploring the spatial structuring of freshwater bacteria metacommunity in a broad geographical scale"_
